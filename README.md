# IArena-2

### What is it ?

`IArena-2` is a rework of the original [IArena](https://github.com/alohner/iArena) game made by [@alohner](https://github.com/alohner), with its main objective to be more accessible by removing the necessity of installing the Unity Game Engine and being fully standalone.  
The content of this git in itself is the Unity project, and the Releases tab contains the standalone versions of the game.

In `IArena-2`, the player makes a script to control the IA of 3 kinds of units :
- `Control` : the central unit, the player must defend it from the enemy units, and losing it will end the game for this player.
- `Destructor` : the heavy unit, with a high health and a high attack power, but with a low movement speed, and a small vision cone.
- `Interceptor` : the light unit, with a lower health and a lower attack power, but with a higher movement speed, and a bigger vision cone.
